!!! warning "Early stage"
	Development on this project has just started, use it with caution

Easily configure and deploy a **fully self-hosted chat web service** based on open source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/).

Available as a `pip` package 🐍, or `docker` image 🐳

- 🌐 Free and Open Source chatbot web service with UI and API
- 🏡 Fully self-hosted, not tied to any service, and offline capable. Forget about API keys! Models and embeddings can be pre-downloaded, and the training and inference processes can run off-line if necessary.
- 🧞 Easy to setup, no need to program, just configure the service with a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, and start the chat web service in 1 command
- ⚡ No need for GPU, this will work even on your laptop CPU (but takes about 1min to answer on recent laptops)
- 🦜 Use [`LangChain`](https://python.langchain.com) to support performant open source models inference:
    - all [Llama-2-GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML) ([7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML)/[13B](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)/[70B](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf))
    - all [Llama-2-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ)
- 📚 Possibility to automatically build similarity vectors from PDF documents, and use them to have the chatbot search documents for you.
- 🪶 Modern and lightweight chat web interface, working as well on desktop as on mobile, with support for light/dark theme

## ℹ️ How it works

1. Install it as a `pip` package 🐍, or use the `docker` image 🐳

2. Configure the service in a `chat.yml` file

3. Start the chat web service from the terminal with `libre-chat start` or `docker run -it -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/vemonet/libre-chat:main`

For more advanced uses, seasoned developers can also use the models, and deploy the API using objects in python scripts.
