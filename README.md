Easily configure and deploy a **fully self-hosted chatbot web service** based on open source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), without the need for knowledge in machine learning or programmation.

</div>

- 🌐 Free and Open Source chatbot web service with UI and API
- 🏡 Fully self-hosted, not tied to any service, and offline capable. Forget about API keys! Models and embeddings can be pre-downloaded, and the training and inference processes can run off-line if necessary.
- 🚀 Easy to setup, no need to program, just configure the service with a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, and start it with 1 command
- 📦 Available as a `pip` package 🐍, or `docker` image 🐳
- 🐌 No need for GPU, this will work even on your laptop CPU! That said, running on CPUs can be quite slow (up to 1min to answer a documents-base question on recent laptops), so we are working on making a better use of GPU when available
- 🦜 Powered by [`LangChain`](https://python.langchain.com) to support performant open source models inference: **Llama 2 GGML** ([7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML) | [13B](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) | [70B](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf)), **Llama 2 GPTQ** ([7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ) | [13B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ) | [70B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GPTQ))
- 🤖 Various types of agents can be deployed:
  - **💬 Generic conversation**: do not need any additional training, just configure settings such as the template prompt
  - **📚 Documents-based question answering**: automatically build similarity vectors from documents uploaded through the API UI, the chatbot will use them to answer your question, and return which documents were used to generate the answer (PDF, CSV, HTML, JSON, markdown, and more supported).
- 🔍 Readable logs to understand what is going on
- 🪶 Modern and lightweight chat web interface, working well on desktop and mobile, with support for light/dark theme, streaming response, and markdown rendering.

## 🏗️ Work in progress

⚠️ Development on this project has just started, use it with caution

Those checkpoints are features we plan to work on in the future, feel free to let us know in the issues if you have any comment or request.

- [x] Add support for returning sources in UI when using documents-based QA
- [x] Stream response to the websocket to show words as they are generated
- [x] Speed up inference, better use of GPUs, especially when doing QA.
- [ ] Look into using [MLC](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/) to run inference (instead of ctransformers)
- [ ] Add button to let the user stop the chatbot generation (for when it goes wild)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment (Helm chart?)
- [ ] Try with Vicuna model
- [ ] Add authentication mechanisms (OAuth/OpenID Connect)
- [ ] Add an admin dashboard web UI to enable users to upload/inspect/delete documents for QA, see/edit the config of the chatbot. Migrate to svelte with config retrieved from API?

## 🐳 Deploy with docker

If you just want to quickly deploy it using the pre-trained model `Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML`, you can use docker:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/vemonet/libre-chat:main
```

You can configure the deployment using environment variables. For this using a `docker compose` and a `.env` file is easier, first create the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  libre-chat:
    image: ghcr.io/vemonet/libre-chat:main
    volumes:
      # ⚠️ Share folders from the current directory to the /data dir in the container
      - ./chat.yml:/data/chat.yml
      - ./models:/data/models
      - ./documents:/data/documents
      - ./embeddings:/data/embeddings
      - ./vectorstore:/data/vectorstore
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
```

And create a `chat.yml` file with your configuration in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
llm:
  model_type: llama
  model_path: ./models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin # We recommend to predownload the files, but you can provide download URLs that will be used if the files are not present:
  model_download: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin
  temperature: 0.01    # Config how creative, but also potentially wrong, the model can be. 0 is safe, 1 is adventurous
  max_new_tokens: 1024 # Max number of words the LLM can generate

prompt:
  # Always use input for the human input variable with a generic agent
  variables: [input, history]
  template: |
    Your are an assistant, please help me

  return_sources_count: 2     # Number of sources to return when generating an answer
  score_threshold: null       # If using the similarity_score_threshold search type. Between 0 and 1

from libre_chat import ChatConf, ChatEndpoint, Llm

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.getLevelName("INFO"))
conf = ChatConf(
	model_path="models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin",
    vector_path=None
)
llm = Llm(conf=conf)
print(llm.query("What is the capital of the Netherlands?"))

# Create and deploy a FastAPI app based on your LLM
app = ChatEndpoint(llm=llm, conf=conf)
uvicorn.run(app)
```
